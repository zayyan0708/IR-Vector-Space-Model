# IR-Vector-Space-Model
This assignment focuses on Vector Space Model(VSM) for information retrieval. We will be implementing and testing a set of queries using VSM for information retrieval.
Vector Space Model (VSM) is a mathematical model that represents documents and queries as vectors of numbers in a high-dimensional space.
Each dimension of the vector represents a term or word in the document or query and the value of the dimension represents the relevance or importance of that term.
The basic idea is that documents and queries can be compared using the similarity between their vectors, typically using the cosine similarity measure. 
In information retrieval, the VSM is used to rank the documents in a collection by their relevance to a user's query, where the relevance is measured by the similarity of the document vector representation to the query vector representation.
